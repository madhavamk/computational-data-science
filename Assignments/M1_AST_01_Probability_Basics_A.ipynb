In the context of data science, statistical inferences are often used to analyze or predict trends from data and these inferences use probability distributions of data. Using probability, we can model elements of uncertainty such as risk in financial transactions and many other business processes such as risk evaluation, sales forecasting, market research etc.\n",

        "- **Outcome:**  a possible result of an experiment or trial.\n",
        "- **Sample space:** the set of all possible outcomes associated with a random experiment.\n",

        "- **Mutually exclusive events:** two events are mutually exclusive if the probability of occurrence of both events simultaneously is zero.\n",
        "- **Dependent events:** two events are dependent if the occurrence of the first affects the occurrence of the second, so the probability is changed.\n",
        "- **Independent events:** two events are independent if occurring or non-occurring of one does not affect the occurring or non-occurring of a second.\n",
        "- **Random variable:** a numerical quantity that is generated by a random experiment.\n",
        "- **Discrete random variable:** a random variable having either a finite or a countable number of possible values.\n",
        "- **Continuous random variable:**  a random variable having a whole interval of numbers of possible values.\n",

        "- **Probability density function:** a probability function associated with a continuous random variable.\n",
