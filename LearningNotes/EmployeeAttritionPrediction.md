## Learnings from the MiniProject - Employee Attrition Prediction

### Situation
Based on the [Synthetic Data generated by IBM](https://data.world/aaizemberg/hr-employee-attrition), I had to create a Machine Learning model
using Boosting techniques, that predicts employee attrition

### Task

- Loading the dataset for EDA
- Identifying and handle the missing values, single values
- Visualising the data for correlation, outliers
- Handling the Outliers
- Handling the correlated features
- Identifying and handling the categorical data
- Apply the boosting techniques and fit the model
- Tune Hyper parameters to improve the model performance
- Evaluate model performance using suitable metrics

### Action

-
